# flask_db_test
Sample flask application that accesses a SQLite database

This application uses a SQLite database backend.  

By navigating to the home page, a cookie is stored with a unique id.  A record in the database is then created with a random text string.

Navigating to the next page displays the string that was initially stored by the home page.
